              <p>Car audio modification-the original car audio system of the car is modified and upgraded to improve the sound field environment and sound quality in the car to meet the "Hifi" needs of car owners for music.</p>
              <br>
              <h2 style="font-family:Cursive;">Why do we need to modify the car audio?</h2>
              <p>As we all know, urban traffic congestion keeps drivers in a state of mental stress, fatigue and sleepiness increase the risk of driving, and sweet music can effectively relax tight nerves. Competition in the automobile market has become increasingly fierce. Manufacturers have increased R&D costs in terms of appearance and power performance. Under the pressure of cost control, the original car’s audio is the first to bear the brunt: The original car’s audio system does not pay attention to unprofessionalism and pursues low cost in the production and development process. The sound is not good. A good horse is equipped with a good saddle, and the wonderful music requires a high-quality sound system and speakers. It is very necessary to modify the original car audio.</p>

              <br>
              <h2 style="font-family: Serif;font-weight: bold;">Things you must know before car audio modification!</h2>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li style="font-weight: bold; font-size:20px;font-family: Cursive; text-align: left;"> You must first know your favorite music style (you can try different music style cars first)</li>
                  <p>Some car owners believe that a good-quality audio system must be suitable for all styles of music, but it is not. Music is unique, and car audio manufacturers will produce different types of speakers for different music styles. Car music styles are mainly divided into 3 categories, SQ, SPL and SQL.<strong style="font-size: large;">SQ (Sound Quality)</strong> is about having clarity and fidelity while being able to hear every single frequency of the song nice and clear. <strong style="font-size: large;">SPL (Sound Pressure Levels)</strong> on the other hand is about being loud & measuring cabin pressure in dB's (Decibels)，And <strong style="font-size: large;">SQL has the characteristics</strong> of both sq and sql.</p>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;font-family: Cursive;font-size: 20px;text-align: left;">Everything starts from reality, seeking truth from facts</li>
                  <p>As the saying goes, "You wear shoes as big as your feet," and the same goes for car audio modification. A set of car audio can be modified for 2000 yuan, and a car stereo can also be modified for 500,000 yuan. The car mainly modifies and upgrades the car according to its actual situation, and does what it can. Don't put too much pressure on yourself for the so-called vanity. This is more than the loss.</p>
                <li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;font-family: Cursive;font-size: 20px;text-align: left;"> Choose a formal professional car audio modification shop</li>
                  <p>Most of the car audio modification in Malaysia is carried out in car beauty shops or car decoration shops, where the technicians basically have no modification experience. They tend to over-promote related equipment and products to car owners, making car owners who have little knowledge of car audio modification think that this is "all". In fact, the audio modification process includes many steps, and car owners can judge themselves from the following aspects<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">How to determine whether the car audio modification shop you are looking for is formal and professional?</span></p>
                    <div style="font-family:Cursive; padding-right: 100px;text-align: left;">
                      <ol>
                        <li>Does the tuning technician really want to understand your needs</li>
                        <li>Does the modification technician understand the characteristics of the sound</li>
                        <li>Whether the sound insulation construction is rigorous and whether there will be abnormal noise after construction</li>
                        <li>Whether the choice of wire and insurance are reasonable</li>
                        <li>Whether the installation process of the horn is exquisite, is it non-destructive installation</li>
                        <li>Have you conducted professional audio debugging</li>
                        <li>Does the modification affect the car warranty</li>
                      </ol>
                    </div>
                <br>
                <p>Even if the same car audio product is installed by different technicians, it may have different effects. It can be seen how important it is to choose a formal professional car audio modification shop! The editor’s suggestion is that before choosing a modified shop, car owners should find a way to check in advance the reviews of different customers on the shop (you can ask relevant groups on Facebook for related inquiries, for example, in Johor, you can ask Johor Blowing Station, or johor car audio modification group to ask for relevant details), or go to the store to see the construction process of the merchant in person, so that you can know it well and save unnecessary trouble.</p>
