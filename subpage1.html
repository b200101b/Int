                      <p>Sound insulation is one of the most important parts in car audio. Without sound insulation, no matter how high-end the equipment is, how good the installation technology of the technicians is, the effect will be unsatisfactory, because noise will cause distortion of the sound, and many people will The sound volume increases, but I don’t know that listening to this kind of distorted music for a long time will make it irritable and headaches. This is out of the original intention of car audio modification.</p>
                      <br>
                        <h2 id="c2">How is vehicle noise produced? </h2>
                        <p>Sound is produced by vibration, and a lot of vibrations will be produced during the driving of the vehicle. The engine will vibrate, the exhaust pipe will vibrate, the friction between the body and the air will generate vibration, and even the vibration generated by the friction between the tire and the ground will be transmitted to the car through the suspension, all of which will cause noise. The scary thing is that if the natural frequency of some parts on the car body coincides with the frequency emitted by these vibration sources, resonance will occur (resonance is one of the important reasons for the premature aging of the vehicle), and after resonance, it will produce more Loud noise.</p>

                        <h2 id="c3"> The concept and principle of car sound insulation</h2>
                      <br>
                        <p>Car sound insulation products were collectively developed by a group of American car audio enthusiasts in the late 1980s, in order to be able to better and more carefully enjoy the fun of car audio. These car sound insulation products can not only help the vehicle reduce the noise generated during driving, but also improve the sound pressure and tone of the car audio, which can be said to kill two birds with one stone. However, there are pros and cons. The sound insulation modification of the vehicle will increase its fuel consumption and weight, and the drainage function of the windows will also be affected to a certain extent, causing the door panels to rust more easily.<br>Under normal circumstances, as long as reducing vibration or absorbing sound can achieve the purpose of sound insulation and noise reduction, there are currently four popular treatment methods.</p>
                          <ol>
                              <li style="font-weight: bold;">First, the damping coefficient of the car body is increased by the anti-vibration plate, and the noise is reduced on the sound source.</li>
                                <img src="stp.jpg" alt="stp soundproof" style="width:540px; height:300px;">
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <li style="font-weight: bold;">Then, use sound-absorbing cotton to absorb the noise.</li>
                              <br>
                                <p>Modification technicians usually use these two methods together, that is, first paste a layer of anti-vibration plate on the car body, and then paste a layer of sound-absorbing cotton on the anti-vibration plate (the effect of sound-absorbing cotton is more obvious where there is a cavity) . Modification technicians may also lay a hybrid material called "low-frequency king" directly on the car chassis to reduce low-frequency noise.</p>
                                <img src="haimian.jpg" alt="xiyinmian" >                       
                              <li style="font-weight: bold;"> Then, modify the double-layer sound insulation glass to directly isolate the noise outside the car</li>
                              <br>
                                <p>Automobile soundproof glass usually chooses laminated glass with a double-layer composite structure, and the soundproof damping glue (membrane) in the middle of the laminated glass plays a role in weakening the sound transmission and can directly and effectively isolate the noise outside the car. The well-known Buick Lacrosse, Cadillac ATS-L Other luxury models have adopted double-layer sound-proof glass design. Worst of all, most of the automotive soundproof glass is dedicated to special vehicles, which is difficult to buy on the market.</p>
                              <li style="font-weight: bold;"> Finally, the most obvious effect is to replace comfortable and quiet tires to reduce tire noise.</li>
                              <br>   
                                  <P>The original car’s tires usually take into consideration cost, grip, fuel consumption and durability. Comfort and quietness may not be considered at the same time. Especially some sports tires and run-flat tires. The tire noise is comparable to a rock concert scene. Replace it directly. A quiet and comfortable tire is the most effective way to reduce noise. The principle of quiet tires of different brands is basically the same, that is, the special design of the tire pattern, structure and material is used to reduce tire noise. The more excellent silent tires on the market include: Goodyear Royal Vehicle II, German Continental MC5/CC6, Pirelli new P7, Michelin Haoyue 3ST and so on. Quiet tires usually have softer treads. Compared with sports tires, they have weaker grip performance, shorter life span, and slightly increased fuel consumption.</P>

                          </ol>
                        <h2 id="c4">Sound insulation steps for cars</h2>  
                          <p>The system's car sound insulation treatment generally includes three steps of shock absorption, noise reduction and sealing. It is not possible to achieve a good sound insulation effect only by building a fire wall.<br><br>Most of the noise is introduced into the car through the suspension system, trunk, chassis and doors of the car, so the first step is to dampen the four doors and the trunk, and then complete the floor in turn , The shock absorption treatment of engine compartment and roof. The second step is to perform sound absorption and noise reduction processing on the entire car. The third step is to seal the inside of the car body. It should be noted that when sealing the interior of the car body, do not over-seal. The car body sealing project is a basic project to reduce the noise transmitted from the outside to the inside. Excessive sealing will cause hypoxia in the car and cause harm to the body of the car owner. Therefore, the modification technician should keep the air pressure inside the car while maintaining good sealing balance<br><br>General sound insulation engineering can reduce the noise by 2-3 decibels, and the selection of good sound insulation materials can reduce the noise in the car by 5-8 decibels, in the best case, it can even drop by 13 decibels. If the construction staff tell you that they can reduce the noise by 20 decibels after completing the sound insulation treatment, then you have to think about whether you have been fooled.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2 id="c5">Selection of sound insulation materials!!!</h2> 
                          <p>The anti-vibration plate is divided into two parts, aluminum foil and adhesive layer. The genuine glue layer will be made of environmentally friendly materials, and the defective product will be replaced by asphalt. The material of the genuine adhesive layer is mostly butyl rubber, and the temperature has very little effect on its state. It will maintain the same state as plasticine during the shelf life. In contrast to asphalt, temperature has a great influence on its state. It seems that there is no problem when the temperature is low, but when the temperature is high, the asphalt will directly melt and volatilize various toxic gases, which is definitely not suitable for use in the car. Because the price of asphalt is low and the form at normal room temperature is very close to rubber, some unscrupulous manufacturers will produce inferior rubber layers to shoddy, which confuses customers.</p>  
                        <br>
                        <h5>There are two ways to distinguish the authenticity of the material!</h5>
                          <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
                            <li>Peel off a small tuft of glue and knead it in your hands. If it is asphalt, your hands will leave stains that are difficult to remove. If it is butyl rubber, your hands will still be clean.</li>
                            <li>Tear off a small tuft of glue and burn it with fire. The state of asphalt is very unstable, and it will melt immediately when it encounters high temperature, so the defective rubber layer will help combustion and gradually turn into liquid when it encounters fire. If it is butyl rubber, it needs to be burned for a period of time before it will burn on its own and does not support combustion.</li>
                          </ul>
